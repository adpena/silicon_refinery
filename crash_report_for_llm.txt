I encountered a crash in my Python application. Here is the traceback:
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/adpena/PycharmProjects/smartypants/silicon_refinery/debugging.py", line 53, in sync_wrapper
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/Users/adpena/PycharmProjects/smartypants/use_cases/09_enhanced_debugging/example.py", line 9, in process_data
    parsed_value = data_payload["value"] + 10
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

```

A local AI agent performed a preliminary analysis and concluded:
- Summary: The error occurs because `data_payload` contains a string, and attempting to add an integer to it results in a TypeError.
- Possible Causes: `data_payload` is not being correctly initialized or parsed as an integer., Data payload format is incorrect, leading to unexpected types in the dictionary.
- Suggested Fix: Ensure `data_payload` is initialized or parsed correctly as an integer before performing arithmetic operations.

Please act as an expert developer (like Jeff Dean or a top-tier engineer). Provide a comprehensive, patched version of the code that resolves this issue, along with any necessary explanations.
