I encountered a crash in my Python application.

Debugging objective for the next agent:
- Perform deep, evidence-based debugging only.
- Avoid assumptions and hallucinations; explicitly call out unknowns.
- Include concrete line/frame references, exception details, and logging clues.
- Prioritize actionable validation steps and instrumentation suggestions.

Crash context:
- Function wrapper: process_data
- Exception: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not 'int') to str
- Stage1 context-window retries used: 0
- Stage2 context-window retries used: 0

Traceback (full, chronological):
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 70, in main
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not 'int') to str

```

Crash envelope (frames + snippets + triage cues):
```text
Crash Envelope

- exception: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not 'int') to str
- traceback_lines: 3

Frame Hints:
- F1 | <stdin>:70 | main | code=

Logging Signals:
- none detected

Source Snippets:
- no readable local source snippets found for traceback frames

Traceback Tail:

```

Query payload sent to the local model (context-budgeted):
```text
You are a senior debugging analyst. Provide a strict, evidence-based diagnosis of this Python failure.

Rules:
- Use only evidence from the provided traceback and signals.
- Do not invent files, line numbers, stack frames, logs, or runtime state.
- If evidence is insufficient, state uncertainty explicitly.
- Focus on root-cause debugging and concrete next validation steps.

Analysis objectives:
1) error_summary: precise failure synopsis tied to exception + likely failing boundary.
2) possible_causes: evidence-backed root-cause candidates.
3) certainty_level: LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH based on evidence quality.
4) severity + blast_radius: practical impact scope.
5) likely_fix_locations: include file paths + line ranges, plus reason and evidence frame IDs.
6) evidence: list concrete proof points citing frame IDs.
7) first_actions_30m + verification_steps + unknowns.
8) suggested_fix: concise initial remediation path.

Output policy:
- Every claim must be grounded in evidence.
- Every likely_fix_locations item must include at least one concrete path:line range.
- Keep output detailed, technical, and implementation-oriented.

Crash context:
- Function wrapper: process_data
- Exception: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not 'int') to str
- Traceback lines provided: 3/3
- Query attempt: 1/1

Relevant frame hints:
- F1 | <stdin>:70 | main | code=

Logging signals:
- none detected

Local source snippets around failing frames:
- no readable local source snippets found for traceback frames


Traceback payload:

```

Local AI forensic triage:
- error_summary: Integer/string type mismatch during arithmetic in process_data
- certainty_level: HIGH
- severity: MEDIUM
- blast_radius: Isolated to request path that forwards string payloads into process_data
- possible_causes: ["data_payload['value'] is a string at runtime (frame F1)", 'Input parsing path skipped numeric normalization before add operation']
- likely_fix_locations: ['use_cases/09_enhanced_debugging/example.py:18-19 | cast payload value before +10 | evidence=F1']
- evidence: ["F1 shows TypeError at arithmetic expression data_payload['value'] + 10", 'Exception text confirms str/int concatenation path']
- first_actions_30m: ["Reproduce with failing payload {'value': '100'} and confirm exception path", 'Patch value normalization and rerun minimal repro']
- verification_steps: ['Run use_cases/09_enhanced_debugging/example.py and confirm no TypeError', 'Add unit test covering str and int payload variants']
- unknowns: ['Upstream callers that may rely on string payload behavior']
- suggested_fix: Normalize data_payload['value'] to int before arithmetic and add type guard logging.

Agent handoff plan:
- objective: Patch root cause, preserve behavior, and verify regression safety.
- prioritized_steps: ['Inspect failing frame and payload typing assumptions', 'Implement explicit int conversion + validation', 'Add focused regression tests for payload typing']
- candidate_edits: ['use_cases/09_enhanced_debugging/example.py:18-19 | normalize value before arithmetic']
- instrumentation: ['use_cases/09_enhanced_debugging/example.py:18 | log incoming value type before conversion']
- verification_commands: ['python use_cases/09_enhanced_debugging/example.py', 'uv run pytest tests/test_debugging.py -q']
- risks: ['Type coercion may mask invalid payloads if validation is too permissive']

Agent handoff prompt:
Investigate the listed frame/file, implement strict value normalization, and validate with the provided verification commands.
