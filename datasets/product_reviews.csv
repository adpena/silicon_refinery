R1,SmartWatch Pro,"The battery life is amazing, easily lasts a week. However, the screen is a bit dim in direct sunlight."
R2,NoiseCancelling Headphones,Terrible audio quality. The bass is non-existent and the noise cancellation barely works. Returning it.
R3,Ergonomic Keyboard,It gets the job done. Comfortable to type on but the keys are a bit too loud for an open office.
R4,4K Monitor,Absolutely stunning visuals! The color accuracy is perfect for my video editing workflow.
